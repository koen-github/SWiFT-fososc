/* General todos:
<&y2011.08.07.16:08:32& Keep into account inequality axioms in FHdoc2nl. If there are no inequality , you should add additional natural language statements, e.g.: "It is possible that .. are different names for the same child". Or better: such texts should not be generated, so simply always add all inequality axioms. >
<_& &y2011.08.07.16:11:12& Interesting problem here: I can simply ASSUME the inequality axioms are there and are correct to make the right translation. However, it would be much more elegant when you would check the inequality axioms, and either produce an error when they are not all present in the right way, OR add additional natural language statements to state an exception to una.>[A &y2012.05.12.12:54:54& made a reasoner which also interprets inequality axioms]
<&y2011.08.07.16:09:55& add argument aggregation in predicates>
