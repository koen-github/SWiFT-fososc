<h1>ConstiGame</h1>
<!-- TODO show other text when player hasn't played sufficient constigames -->
The ConstiGame is explained in <a href="constiGameHelp.html">here</a>. Note that you can only start to play this game, after you have played sufficient fluency games, because you have to gain experience to be able to write new constitutions. In that case, a new menu item will appear on the left side titled "Constitutions". As soon as this menu item appears, and the constitution list below is empty, then click it and follow or create one or more constitutions. These constitutions will appear in the list below.

<h2>Score of constitutions you follow</h2>
