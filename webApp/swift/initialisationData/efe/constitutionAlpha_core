<P>A constant is a word that stands for a certain entity (which could
be a person, a table, an armadillo, you name it). Examples of
constants in efeLang are:</P>
<UL>
        <li><P><B>c</B></P></li>
        <li><P><B>c1</B></P></li>
        <li><P><B>obama</B></P></li>
        <li><P><B>oeir33u_ij</B></P></li>
        <li><P><B>president_HuJintao</B></P></li>
</UL>
<P>Constants should always start with a lower case letter, while the
rest may not contain anything other than digits (0, 1, 2, ...), lower
and upper case letters (a,b, c, ..., A, B, C, ...), and underscores
(_).</P>
<P>You are free to choose any constant for a thing you want to refer
to. You can choose the constant <B>obama</B> to represent the
president Obama, but you could just as well have chosen <B>c1</B>.
Although you are free to choose any constant to refer to the entity
you have in mind, you must stick to your choice throughout the
document. Each new occurrence of the same constant in the document,
thus, refers to the same entity. On the other hand, you are free to
choose different constants to refer to the same entity.</P>
<H4>1.1.2 The B and the F predicate</H4>
<P>You can make two types of statements about the constants you
introduced, by using the so-called <I>predicates</I> B or F. B
expresses that something is big, and F that it is fast. Section 1.2
explains how you can use them create sentences.</P>
<P><B>1.2 Sentences</B></P>
<P>You can make two types of statements about the constants
you introduced, by using the predicates B or F. B expresses that
something is big, and F that it is fast. Their usage is defined by
example in the following:</P>
<P><B>B(ob)</B></P>
<P>Meaning: assume that the constant ob has been chosen to stand for
"president Obama", than this sentence means: President Obama is
big.</P>
<P><B>F(ob)</B></P>
<P>Meaning: under the same assumption, this means President Obama is
fast.</P>
<P>Note that these statements can be made about anything, even if it
doesn't make sense. Suppose that the constant mFC is chosen to mean
"my favourite chair", then the following is a statement you are
allowed to make:</P>
<P><B>F(mFC)</B></P>
<P>Meaning: my favourite chair is fast</P>
<P><B>1.3 Documents</B></P>
<P>A document is a sequence of sentences separated by newlines. The
meaning of a document is that all the sentences are supposed to hold
true. A document may consist of one or more sentences. For example:</P>
<P><B>B(ob)</B></P>
<P><B>F(ob)</B></P>
<P><B>F(mFC)</B></P>
<P>Meaning (using the earlier introduced
meanings of the constants): Obama is big, Obama is fast and my
favourite chair is fast.</P>
