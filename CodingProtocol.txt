- When adding new artificats to the pom.xml file, always refer to a specific version of an artifact. If you don't do this, maven may attempt to download the newest version, while the code has not been adapted yet. E.g. you can run into missing goals (because they were deprecated), your code may not compile (because the code refers to deprecated classes), etc. etc.
