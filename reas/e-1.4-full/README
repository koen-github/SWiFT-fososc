This distribution of E 1.4 (Namring) has been compiled according to
the "README" file included in the official version from
http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/E/E.html.

    $ tar zxvf E.tgz
    $ cd E
    $ ./configure
    $ make

The Mac OS X executables were built on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).
64-bit executables were built by adding "-m64" to "ARCHFLAGS" and
"LDFLAGS" in "Makefile.vars". Similarly, 32-bit Linux executables were
built by specifying "-m32". The executables were "strip"ped.

A selection of the executables in "PROVER/" are moved to the
platform-specific target directory (e.g., "x86-linux"). The file
"eproof" is slightly modified to avoid a premature timeout.

Enjoy!
